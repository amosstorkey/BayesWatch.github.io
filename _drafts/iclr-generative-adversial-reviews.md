### [Generative Adversarial Networks as Variational Training of Energy Based Models](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ry7O1ssex)
### *Shuangfei Zhai, Yu Cheng, Rogerio Feris, Zhongfei Zhang*

(One or two paragraphs describing paper and any thoughts on it)

### [Improved Techniques for Trainings GANs][improved]
### *Tim Salimans, Ian Goodfellow, Wojciech Zaremba, Vicki Cheung, Alec Radford, Xi Chen*

This paper has two parts: four recommended techniques for training GANs and
a thorough evaluation with visual Turing tests and semi-supervised tasks.
That is more concrete than the feature extraction and visualisation in, for
example, Radford's [DCGAN paper][dcgan].

The shortest description of the four techniques can be found on the
[summary for this paper][short] on shortscience. Just going to expand a
little on that summary.
