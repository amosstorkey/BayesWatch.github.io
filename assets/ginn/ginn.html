                <p> Clicking the above buttons will take you to the interactive illustrations of neural network non-linear boundaries. They are designed to show the non-linear boundaries of neurons in a neural network. The point at which any neuron in a 3 layer (each of which has 16 neurons) neural network moves from inactive to active can be visualised as a line (for ReLUs, in this case). The image on the left can either show the target data or the network's predictions. The loss curve at the top accompanies the visualisation to relate loss and performance. </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;"> An individual data item is an (x, y) pixel location and the target is a single binary value representing either a black or white intensity. </p>
                <p> Therefore, this visualisation shows the ENTIRE DATA DOMAIN at all times - the image on the left is NOT the input to the network. Instead, an individual pixel location is fed into it to produce predictions </p>
